Implementation of a shifting discontinuous-gridblock lattice Boltzmann method for moving boundary
simulations(Conversion to 3D underway).
Local refinement using multiblock saves cost.
Generalized it for cases when the object moves.
Body-fitted refined mesh reduces spurious oscillation.
MRT over SRT is used for stability.
Linear, quadratic and cubic interpolation used.
Test case: Neutrally-buoyant cylinder placed off-centerline.
